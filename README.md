TerraKit.io AWS Network starter
-------------------------------

`aws-starter-network` is a terraform module providing a starter network for your
AWS based infrastructure.  It includes everything you need at a VPC level for
most standard workloads.

This module can be used multiple times to create logically separated
environments.  Create isolated environments for production and development, or
perhaps different tenants.
